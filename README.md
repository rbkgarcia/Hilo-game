# Hilo-game

## Description
Hilo is a game where a player guesses if the next card the dealer draws will be higher or lower than the previous one. So you earn and lose points depending on whether your answer is correct.
To carry out this program, two classes were defined, using the abstraction to represent the most essential elements of the game according to the following rules.

-The player starts the game with 300 points.
-Individual cards are represented as a number from 1 to 13.
-The current card is displayed.
-The player guesses if the next one will be higher or lower.
-The the next card is displayed.
-The player earns 100 points if they guessed correctly.
-The player loses 75 points if they guessed incorrectly.
-If a player reaches 0 points the game is over.
-If a player has more than 0 points they decide if they want to keep playing.
-If a player decides not to play again the game is over.

# Development Environment

This program was built using Python 3, with Visual code studio as the development environment.  
I used the git tools of Visual Studio Code and GitHub to create a version control of my program and the repository of my program.
